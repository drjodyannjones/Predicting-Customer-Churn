# Refactor Predict Customer Churn Model


## Project Description
In this project, I will walk you through the refactoring of a jupyter notebook for a customer churn prediction model. The scenario is as follows: a bank manager grows increasingly perturbed by the number of customers cancelling their credit cards and so has consulted us to build a model that will predict the likelihood of a customer churning so that management can make a data-informed decision on how to intervene.

In this project, I will refactor the notebook by creating a modular script where each step of the machine learning process is encapsulated in a function that can be easily reused. I will also perform tests and logging in order to ensure that the code is up to PEP-8 standards.

The dataset for this project was downloaded from Kaggle, and can be found <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sakshigoyal7/credit-card-customers">here</a>.

An example of the structure of the data can be seen in the image below:
