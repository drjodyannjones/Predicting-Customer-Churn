# Predict Customer Churn

- Project **Predict Customer Churn** of ML DevOps Engineer Nanodegree Udacity

## Project Description
In this project, I will walk you through the refactoring of a jupyter notebook for a customer churn prediction model. The scenario is as follows: a bank manager grows increasingly perturbed by the number of customers cancelling their credit cards and so has consulted us to build a model that will predict the likelihood of a customer churning.

In this project, I will refactor the notebook by creating a modular script where each step of the maching learning process is encapsulated in a function that can be easily reused. I will also perform tests and logging in order to ensure that the code is up to PEP-8 standards.
