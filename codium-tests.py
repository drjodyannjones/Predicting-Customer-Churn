"""
Code Analysis:
-This function takes in a path to a csv file as an argument and returns a pandas dataframe. 
-It reads the csv file and creates a new column called 'Churn' which is a binary response variable. 
-The 'Churn' column is encoded such that 0 represents an existing customer and 1 represents a customer who has churned. 
-The 'Attrition_Flag' column is then dropped from the dataframe.
"""

"""
Test Plan:
- test_load_data_csv(): tests that the csv is loaded correctly.
- test_create_churn_column(): tests that the 'Churn' column is created correctly.
- test_encode_churn_column(): tests that the 'Churn' column is encoded correctly.
- test_drop_attrition_flag_column(): tests that the 'Attrition_Flag' column is dropped correctly.
- test_return_dataframe(): tests that the function returns a pandas dataframe.
- test_edge_case_empty_csv(): tests the edge case where passing an empty csv leads to an empty dataframe.
